            <p>The Dstike Deauther Watch (version 3) is a simple yet functional device. It uses an ESP8266 Wi-Fi chip,
              commonly found in many tech gadgets, including Wi-Fi light bulbs.
              <br><br>
              The watch features a small screen and battery, running a Deauther tool created by Spacehuhn. This tool
              allows you to disconnect any device from a 2.4G Wi-Fi network. Unlike illegal jammers, which create noise
              and can interfere with emergency services, the Dstike watch uses deauthentication frames to make devices
              disconnect from Wi-Fi networks. Essentially, it forces a phone or laptop to drop its connection.
            </p>

            <h3><b>what can it do?</b></h3>
          </div>

          <div class="w3-container">
            <p>The Dstike Deauther watch can kick devices off their Wi-Fi networks, which is very annoying. It can also
              perform a beacon attack to create fake access points with custom names, and a probe attack to confuse
              Wi-Fi trackers. It allows you to monitor Wi-Fi traffic and has a clock with NTP time server
              synchronization and a powerful laser pointer.
              <br><br>
              Like other ESP8266 development boards, it can run different software if desired. However, the ESP8266 chip
              only works on 2.4GHz Wi-Fi, so it doesn't affect every network.

            <h3><b>How much of a threat is it?</b></h3>
          </div>

          <div class="w3-container">
            <p>The goal of Spacehuhn's project is to highlight a major flaw in older Wi-Fi implementations and provide a
              tool to test against them. Fortunately, many new routers protect against this with a feature called
              protected management frames.
              <br><br>
              Despite this, many older devices are still vulnerable, allowing for potential disruptions, though the
              attack mostly just forces a re-login. More seriously, a Deauther tool could bump a target off a legitimate
              network onto an attacker-controlled network, setting up an injection attack as the first step in a
              malicious chain.
              <br><br>
              The project's goal is to help secure your own network, not to annoy others. The watch itself is not
              unique; it simply runs a script that can be used on any ESP8266 board, which typically costs around $3 on
              Amazon or AliExpress.

            <h4><b>Could I use it myself?</b></h4>
            <p>Thereâ€™s plenty of information in the wiki and videos online on how to set up the Dstike Deauther watch.
              Since the watch is just a fun package for the Deauther tool, it's one of the more accessible hacking tools
              available. If you want to try personal security testing for almost nothing, many guides show you how to
              set it up.
              <br><br>
              In addition to the OLED screen, the watch has a convenient web interface you can connect to via your
              smartphone or PC. Just remember to use it on your own networks to avoid causing trouble.
              <br><br>
              You could also simply use it as a watch. It's a raw black PCB in a clear plastic enclosure, embodying a
              brutally functional and simple design. Think of it as an anti-Apple Watch: focused, practical, and with a
              Hackers-inspired sense of style.
