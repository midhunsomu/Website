            <p>The Flipper Zero looks like a toy but is actually a powerful multi-tool for hacking. It's a small,
              plastic device with a playful dolphin on its screen. Despite its cute appearance, it's a versatile tool,
              similar to a Swiss Army knife, for interacting with electronics. Successfully funded on Kickstarter with
              $4.6 million, it's open-source and stylish.
            </p>
            <p>
              What makes the Flipper Zero unique is its flexibility. Unlike other tools, it can communicate with various
              devices, including sub-1GHz devices (like old garage doors), Low- and High-Frequency RFID, NFC cards,
              Infrared devices, and Bluetooth. While some use it for pranks, like remotely opening Tesla charging ports,
              its true strength is in its ability to interact with nearly any wireless device.

          </div>

          <div class="w3-container">
            <p>The Flipper Zero is a versatile tool with multiple antennas for various tasks. The sub-1GHz transceiver
              interacts with devices like old garage doors, pagers, gates, gas station price signs, and doorbells. The
              125kHz antenna reads, clones, and emulates older prox cards. The NFC module reads, writes, and emulates
              both low and high-frequency NFC devices like tap cards. The infrared transceiver learns and replicates IR
              device signals, like remotes for air conditioners or sound bars. Additionally, the Flipper can perform
              BadUSB attacks when connected to a computer via USB, using Ducky Scripts. It can also store U2F keys for
              two-factor authentication. You can control it with your phone via Bluetooth and store data on a microSD
              card.
              <br><br>
              Importantly, the Flipper Zero does not have WiFi out of the box. However, you can easily add a WiFi
              Devboard or ESP8266 using the GPIO pins for projects like pen-testing, deauth, probes, and more. The
              device benefits from a robust and vibrant community, with numerous online resources and creative uses
              constantly being discovered. It can run a unique version of DOOM, as well as Tetris and Flappy Bird. You
              can emulate Skylanders and Amiibos, and even engage in old-fashioned phone phreaking with a working pay
              phone. Being open source, you can also install your own firmware, which many users do.

            <p>This is where we get into territory that gets shipments held up by Customs. The Flipper Zero is a
              powerful tool and could be used maliciously in the wrong hands, but this is also true for a Raspberry Pi
              turned into a Pwnagotchi, various ESP8266 boards, or even just a phone.
              <br><br>
              It's important to remember that a tool's usefulness or danger depends on the user. The tools to create
              chaos exist, but it takes planning and intent. An individual has to choose to copy keycards, tamper with
              gas station price signs, or force someone's computer to subscribe to a YouTube channel. Most hacking tools
              are primarily useful for testing one's own security, not attacking others.
              <br><br>
              Some people just want to experiment with wireless signals. Many Flipper Zero users simply use it for
              harmless tasks like turning on their air conditioner. On its own, the Flipper Zero isn't going to turn IT
              professionals into hackers from a video game. Many users will just use it to clone keys for convenience or
              play harmless pranks on Tesla owners.

            <h4><b>Could I use it myself?</b></h4>
            <p>Absolutely. The app for the Flipper Zero is very straightforward, with a simple interface. Users
              continuously add robust scripts, easily found on GitHub. There's also a healthy forum and a friendly
              Discord server for help with projects, which is quite rare these days.

              That is, of course, if you can get your hands on one. The same goes for a Raspberry Pi. Good luck with
              that in the near future!
