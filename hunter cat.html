            <p>The Hunter Cat is a small, credit card-sized device powered by a coin battery. You swipe it into a card
              reader at a vape shop or gas station ATM and check the lights. A “warning” or “dangerous” light means you
              should use a different machine. To reset, click the button. It has a sleep function that turns it off
              after 15 seconds to save battery.
              <br><br>
              Made by Electronic Cats and Salvador Mendoza, the Hunter Cat uses an ATMEL SAMD11 Arm Microcontroller. It
              detects the number of magnetic heads in a card reader. A normal reader has one head; if it detects more,
              it shows a warning light, indicating a possible card skimmer.

          </div>

          <div class="w3-container">
            <p>The Hunter Cat can detect malicious card skimmers in ATMs, saving you from the hassle of calling your
              bank. However, it currently can't protect NFC card data, though the Hunter Cat NFC is available for that
              purpose. NFC skimming is a risk, but tap cards usually have better security than magnetic stripes, making
              other methods easier for thieves.
              <br><br>
              In addition to skimmers, there are devices called card "shimmers" that target the EMV chip by inserting
              themselves between the chip and the reader. Despite these threats, magnetic stripe skimming remains the
              most common and easiest method for stealing credit card info, not just at gas station pumps.

            <p>Many of the tools we've discussed are designed for hacking, but the Hunter Cat is meant to protect you
              from getting hacked. For the average consumer, it could be a lifesaver. For a scammer trying to skim your
              card via the magnetic stripe, it means they won't get your card info to make fraudulent purchases. Tough
              luck for them! They'll have to resort to other methods to steal your credit card information.

            <h4><b>Could I use it myself?</b></h4>
            <p>Absolutely—it couldn't be easier. If you travel a lot or worry about getting skimmed, you'll find the
              Hunter Cat useful. It's affordable and non-intrusive, easily stored in your car's glove compartment or
              bag, though it's larger than a credit card and won't fit in your wallet. The lights are simple to use and
              read, making it ideal for non-hackers. Just remember, it only protects against simple magnetic stripe
              skimmers, and many places are phasing out magnetic stripes in favor of EMV, tap cards, and other
              contactless payment systems.
