          </div>

          <div class="w3-container">
            <p>It's just an ordinary, unremarkable USB cable—or so a hacker would want you to think.
              <br><br>
              "It's a cable that looks identical to the other cables you already have," explains MG, the cable's
              creator. "But inside each cable, I've put an implant with a web server, USB communications, and Wi-Fi
              access. So it plugs in, powers up, and you can connect to it."
              <br><br>
              This ordinary-looking cable is designed to snoop on the data that passes through it and send commands to
              whatever phone or computer it's connected to. It even has a built-in Wi-Fi access point. The latest
              version includes expanded network capabilities, allowing for bidirectional communication over the
              internet—receiving commands from a control server and sending data from the connected device back to the
              attacker.

            <p>Stressing again that this looks like a totally normal USB cable, its power and stealth are impressive.
              <br><br>
              Firstly, like the USB Rubber Ducky, the O.MG cable can perform keystroke injection attacks, making a
              target machine think it's a keyboard and then typing commands. This allows it to launch software, download
              malware, or steal saved Chrome passwords and send them over the internet.
              <br><br>
              It also has a keylogger. If used to connect a keyboard to a computer, the cable can record every keystroke
              and save up to 650,000 key entries in its onboard storage. Your password? Logged. Bank account details?
              Logged. Even bad draft tweets? Logged.
              <br><br>
              While this likely requires physical access to the target machine, many "evil maid" attacks can be executed
              in real life.
              <br><br>
              Lastly, about that built-in Wi-Fi. Many exfiltration attacks, like stealing Chrome passwords, rely on
              using the target machine's internet connection, which can be blocked by antivirus software or network
              rules. The cable's onboard network interface bypasses these protections, providing its own communications
              channel to send and receive data, even from targets that are air-gapped, or completely disconnected from
              external networks.
              <br><br>
              Basically, this cable can spill your secrets without you ever knowing.

          </div>

          <div class="w3-container">
            <p>The scary thing about the O.MG cable is its extreme stealth. Holding the cable, there’s nothing
              suspicious about it. If someone offered it as a phone charger, I wouldn’t think twice. With options like
              Lightning, USB-A, and USB-C, it can target almost any device, including Windows, macOS, iPhone, and
              Android, making it suitable for various environments.
              <br><br>
              This cable can spill your secrets.
              <br><br>
              For most people, the threat of being targeted is very low. The Elite version costs $179.99, making it a
              tool for professional penetration testing rather than something a low-level scammer could afford to leave
              around, hoping to snare a target. However, costs tend to decrease over time, especially with a streamlined
              production process. “I originally made these in my garage by hand, and it took me four to eight hours per
              cable,” MG told me. Now, years later, a factory handles the assembly.
              <br><br>
              Overall, you’re unlikely to be hacked with an O.MG cable unless you’re a valuable target. But it’s a good
              reminder that anyone with access to sensitive information should be cautious about what they plug into a
              computer, even something as seemingly innocuous as a cable.

            <h4><b>Could I use it myself?</b></h4>
            <p>I didn’t get a chance to test the O.MG cable directly, but judging by the online setup instructions and
              my experience with the Rubber Ducky, you don’t need to be an expert to use it.
              <br><br>
              The cable requires some initial setup, like flashing firmware to the device, but it can then be programmed
              through a web interface accessible from a browser. You can write attack scripts in a modified version of
              DuckyScript, the same language used by the USB Rubber Ducky. When I tested the Rubber Ducky, I found the
              language easy enough to learn, though there are a few things that could trip up an inexperienced
              programmer.
              <br><br>
              Given the price, this wouldn’t make sense as a first hacking gadget for most people. However, with some
              time and motivation, someone with basic technical knowledge could find many ways to use it.
