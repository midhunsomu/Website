          <div class="w3-container">
            <p>The Ubertooth One is a compact, open-source USB device with an antenna, powered by an ARM Cortex-M3 chip
              and a CC2400 wireless transceiver. When plugged into a computer, it can sniff and monitor Bluetooth
              signals from nearby devices.
              <br><br>
              Originally created by Michael Ossmann of Great Scott Gadgets in 2011, the Ubertooth One replaced earlier,
              expensive Bluetooth monitoring devices like the Ellisys Bluetooth Explorer, which costs as much as a used
              car. The Ubertooth One offers the same functionality in a smaller, more affordable package at around $125,
              making it much more accessible.

          <div class="w3-container">
            <p>The Ubertooth One was the first affordable Bluetooth sniffer, revolutionizing the field. It can be
              configured to snoop on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices using software like Wireshark, Kismet, and even
              some government programs. However, it has limitations. While it excels at targeting the newer BLE
              standard, which has seen most Bluetooth innovations in recent years, it is not particularly effective at
              sniffing Bluetooth Classic. This limits its usefulness for older devices.</p>

            <h3><b>How much of a threat is it?</b></h3>
          </div>

          <div class="w3-container">
            <p>While the Ubertooth One is not going to be as useful as a commercial Bluetooth sniffer, there is still
              quite a bit you can do with it or a similar device. There are tons of BLE devices out there, and many
              people don’t think about Bluetooth as a vulnerability.
              <br><br>
              That said, while the device is robust and has had a lot of support, there have been innovations within the
              space since it was created. Companies like Adafruit and Nordic Semiconductor also offer cheap dongles for
              sniffing BLE devices and various other attacks. You can even use the developer mode of an Android phone to
              snag Bluetooth logs, along with both Linux- and macOS-based computers. Programs like Wireshark and
              Bettercap allow you to extract quite a bit of information from Bluetooth devices. With a little bit of
              work, you can reverse engineer Bluetooth devices like heart rate monitors, blood pressure monitors,
              Bluetooth lockers, and much more. Or you could just reverse engineer a light, connect it to Home
              Assistant, and turn it on with a Python script.

            <h4><b>Could I use it myself?</b></h4>
            <p>I won't say you couldn't. The project is mature, robust, and well-documented for those eager to learn.
              Programs like Wireshark are fairly straightforward. However, more intuitive devices are available for
              beginners in pentesting and hacking, such as the WiFi Nugget or the Flipper Zero. For many, an Android
              phone or a laptop with Kali Linux would be a good starting point..</p>
